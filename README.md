# Kadenze Session 5

###### Markus Hudobnik

### Goals
* To create a simple Wiimote to gestures mapping.

### Tools/Libraries
* Osculator, Trigger_textDTW, Wekinator, Wekinator Helper

### What was accomplished
* I finished the model using the velocity helper to smooth out the motions of the Wii Remote

### Machine Learning
* I don't have the data, because I do not know what it means or what to really do with it. After googling, I still don't know so hopefully next project I will know.
* I used DTW for the mapping and it used Dynamic Time Wrapping.
